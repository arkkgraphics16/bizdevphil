# Image placement

Place project previews inside the corresponding folders within `images/previews/`. Each preview should have two files:

- `brand.jpg` — the default brand or cover image
- `preview.jpg` — the hover/alternate website screenshot

Update the extensions if you prefer PNG or WebP, but keep the filenames the same so the data bindings continue to work.

Add your portrait photo to `images/profile/portrait.jpg` to display it on the About page sidebar.
